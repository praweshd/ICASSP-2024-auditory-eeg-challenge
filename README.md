## Description

Goal: build the best model to relate speech to EEG. 
Dataset: Auditory EEG dataset from 105 subjects who listened to ~108 minutes of single-speaker stimuli for a total of around 200 hours of data. 
Tasks: We define two tasks:

(1) Match-mismatch: given 5 segments of speech and a segment of EEG, which segment of speech matches the EEG?

(2) Regression: reconstruct the mel spectorgram from the EEG! . We provide the dataset, code for preprocessing the EEG and for creating commonly used stimulus representations, and two baseline methods.
